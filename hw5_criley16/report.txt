Neighbor Vs Kitsch

The neighbor branches vary more widely and also have lengths below zero. 
It also has no single root and it seems some are evolving faster than others in the tree.
Kitsch has all branches gradually increasing from the root and the farthest distances are all equal.
The rate of each leafs evolution is roughly equal to the others
