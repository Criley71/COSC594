Assembly Size: 4,995,393
Average Contig Size: 64,875
N50: 112,039
reference coverage = 93.15%

When performing the alignment on the assembly and reference genomes I found 77 conitgs using the show-coords
prgram and counting all unique tags produced. The assembly size was 4,995,393 nucleotides long with an average
contig size of 64,875. The N50 is 112,039 meaning that half of the assembly is in contigs longer than 112,039 nucleotides.
Finding the reference coverage the total amount was 93.15% covered with some contigs being 100% covered with others
being less than 6% covered. Combining all these factors together this appears to be a decent assembly with the pros 
being the genome having a good N50 and decent contig coverage. However, the large amount of contigs means that the
sequence is fragmented with some contigs being poorly covered.
