11 indels
16 snps

When compaing the ames and ames ancestor using Mummer's show-snps 
only 27 total variations are found. Specifically 11 indels and 16 snps.
Looking closer the BUFF column in the file shows the distance since the last
indel or snps, with a few happening close to one another, within about 55 
nucleotides, or quite far apart, typically over 100,000 nucleotides away. 
With only 27 variations the genetic variation between ames and its ancestor
are significantly small with each sequence being 5.3 million nucleotides long.
This is about a 0.00051% variation between the 2 genomes. Overall this signifies 
no major structural variation between the sequences but the amount of closely 
spaces indels and snps may show that a gene may be different but no where on a
large scale is it significant. A possible biological hypothesis from this analysis
could be the variations caused a change that makes the ames organism different from 
the ames ancestor leading to natural selection having the mutation become the 
norm for the ames organsims.
