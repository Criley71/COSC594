11 indels
16 snps

When compaing the ames and ames ancestor using Mummer's show-snps 
only 27 total variations are found. Specifically 11 indels and 16 snps.
Looking closer the BUFF column in the file shows the distance since the last
indel or snps, with a few happening close to one another, within about 55 
nucleotides, or quite far apart, typically over 100,000 nucleotides away. 
With only 27 variations the genetic variation between ames and its ancestor
are significantly small with each sequence being 5.3 million nucleotides long.
This is about a 0.00051% variation between the 2 genomes. Overall this signifies 
no major structural variation between the sequences but the amount of closely 
spaces indels and snps may show that a gene may be different but no where on a
large scale is it significant. A possible biological hypothesis from this analysis
could be the variations caused a change that makes the ames organism different from 
the ames ancestor leading to natural selection having the mutation become the 
norm for the ames organsims.

contigs: 77
Assembly Size: 4,995,393
Average Contig Size: 64,875
N50: 112,039
reference coverage = 93.15%

When performing the alignment on the assembly and reference genomes I found 77 
conitgs using the show-coords program and counting all unique tags produced. 
The assembly size was 4,995,393 nucleotides long with an average contig size
of 64,875. The N50 is 112,039 meaning that half of the assembly is in contigs 
longer than 112,039 nucleotides. Finding the reference coverage the total amount 
was 93.15% covered with some contigs being 100% covered with others
being less than 6% covered. Combining all these factors together this appears to be 
a decent assembly with the pros being the genome having a good N50 and decent contig coverage. 
However, the large amount of contigs means that the sequence is fragmented with some contigs being poorly covered.
While the sequence should be good for most purposes, the lack of the full sequence with this many
contigs means that it shouldnt be used for full sequence structural inferences with the limited sequence.
