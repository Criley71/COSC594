I have read and agree to the terms of the COSC 494/594 Honor Code.
=================================================
USAGE:
1.extract tar file and move to directory:
  > tar -xvf criley16_hw1.tar
  > cd criley16_hw1

2. compile using makefile
  > make 
  2a. if make doesnt work
    > g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -o reverse_complement reverse_complement.cpp
    > g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -o frequency_analysis frequency_analysis.cpp
    > g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -o model_probability model_probability.cpp
    > g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -o markov_generator markov_generator.cpp

3. for part 3, Reverse Complement Generator
  > ./reverse_complement

4. for part 4, Nucleotide and Dinucleotide Frequencies
  > ./frequency_analysis
  4a. If given a fasta file as a command line argument it will give the frequencies for that sequence
      otherwise it will do lambda.fasta by default

5. for part 6, Sequence Probability Modeling
  > ./model_probability

6. for part 7, Markov-Based Random Sequence Generator, this will output to markov_simulated.fasta
  > ./markov_generator
  6a. if you want to do frequency analysis on the generated sequence:
    > ./frequency_analysis markov_simulated.fasta

=================================================

Part 6)
Neanderthal Multinomial Model log-probability:        -452.662312232692
Neanderthal Third-Order Markov Model log-probability: -451.796605782161
The replacement of N's with A's actually affected the ouput, the markov model being 
more probable is interesting as it requires more specific sequences 


Part 7)
Comparing the probabilities of the nucleotides and dinucleotides between the 
human mitochondria sequence and the sequence generated using a third-order 
Markov model trained on the human mitochondria sequence, the probabilities
of the dinucleotides are very similar where the largest difference is about 
a .0015 in AG (at least for what I generated, a new one is made when running markov_generator)
All other dinucleotides had a probability difference less than that between the
actual vs generated sequences.
