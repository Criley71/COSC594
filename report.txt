1)USAGE: 
  1.extract tar file and move to directory:
    > tar -xvf hw2_criley.tar
    > cd hw2_criley
  2. compile using makefile
    > make 
  2a. if make doesnt work
    g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o globalign globalign.cpp
    g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o localign localign.cpp
    g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o egfalign egfalign.cpp
    g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ls_egfalign ls_egfalign.cpp

2) Global Alignment Results:
USAGE: 
  >./globalign
RESULTS
Alignment Score: -1016
Number of matches:    1137/2848 (39.9228%)
Number of gaps:       1579/2848 (55.4424%)
Number of mismatches: 132/2848 (4.63483%)

3) Local Alignment Results:
USAGE: 
  >./localign
RESULTS:
Max Alignment Score: 820
Sequence starts at Coordinates (190, 3) and ends at coordinates (1489, 1267)
The sequence is 1360 nucleotides long
Number of matches:    779/1360 (57.2794%)
Number of gaps:       157/1360 (11.5441%)
Number of mismatches: 424/1360 (31.1765%)

The local Alignment sequence is about half as long as the global alignment sequence.
The amount of gaps has decreased while the amount of matches and mismatches increase in frequency.
With the scoring being +2 for matches, -1 for mismatches and -2 for gaps leads to the score being 
-1016 in the global alignment, but with the significant decreases in gaps, the local score maxes out at 820.
Biologically, this sequence may be a shared gene between the 2 species or can even show a common anscestory.

4) End-Gap Free Alignment Results:
USAGE:
  > ./egfalign 
RESULTS:
Alignment Score: 620
The sequence is 345 nucleotides long
Number of matches:    322/345 (93.3333%)
Number of gaps:       1/345 (0.289855%)
Number of mismatches: 22/345 (6.37681%)

5) Blastn Comparison
Score = 284 bits (366),  Expect = 9e-80
Identities = 294/405 (73%), Gaps = 0/405 (0%)
The blastn sequence is significantly shorter than the local alignment I calculated
This could be due to the scoring metrics of blastn, as it had a higher match rate and no gaps compared to mine.

6) Mystery Sequence
Using blastn, the top results were all mosquitos, specifically mosquitos that are vectors
of disease for malaria, the Anopheles coluzzii.
The top 5 species name and accession:
Anopheles coluzzii XM_049606281
Anopheles gambiae  XM_061651125.1
Anopheles coluzzii XM_049606276.1
Anopheles gambiae  XM_061651120.1
Anopheles coluzzii XM_049606279.1

7) Linear Space End-Gap Free Alignment
USAGE:
  > ./ls_egfalign
RESULTS:
Score: 620
The main trade off is the lack of trace back unless using Hirschberg's algorithm.
However, since we only need the score, only the current row and previous row are needed.
meaning we would have a space of m where m is the size of one of the DNA sequences,
as we only need 2 vectors of size m for the algorithm.
