2) Global Alignment Results:
Alignment Score: -1016
Number of matches:    1137/2848 (39.9228%)
Number of gaps:       1579/2848 (55.4424%)
Number of mismatches: 132/2848 (4.63483%)

3) Local Alignment Results:
Max Alignment Score: 820
Sequence starts at Coordinates (190, 3) and ends at coordinates (1489, 1267)
The sequence is 1360 nucleotides long
Number of matches:    779/1360 (57.2794%)
Number of gaps:       157/1360 (11.5441%)
Number of mismatches: 424/1360 (31.1765%)

The local Alignment sequence is about half as long as the global alignment sequence.
The amount of gaps has decreased while the amount of matches and mismatches increase in frequency.
With the scoring being +2 for matches, -1 for mismatches and -2 for gaps leads to the score being 
-1016 in the global alignment, but with the significant decreases in gaps, the local score maxes out at 820.
Biologically, this sequence may be a shared gene between the 2 species or can even show a common anscestory.

4) End-Gap Free Alignment Results:
Alignment Score: 620
The sequence is 345 nucleotides long
Number of matches:    322/345 (93.3333%)
Number of gaps:       1/345 (0.289855%)
Number of mismatches: 22/345 (6.37681%)

5) Blastn Comparison
Score = 284 bits (366),  Expect = 9e-80
Identities = 294/405 (73%), Gaps = 0/405 (0%)
The blastn sequence is significantly shorter than the local alignment I calculated
This could be due to the scoring metrics of blastn, as it had a higher match rate and no gaps compared to mine.
